# contractor
Automatically generate a user interface for any EVM smart contract you have an ABI for.

This is a pretty quick and dirty prototype at the moment, but mostly works.

## Why
Wanted a general purpose front end for interfacing with arbitrary contracts on arbitrary networks.

## How
Vanilla JS, ES modules, WalletConnect, ethers...

## Hacking
`npm run dev`

## Example
